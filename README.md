# TelegramBot-TheAyyBot
A random collection of features that should probably be organised into many different bots, but yea, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   
Please don't take the code quality of this project as an example of my work, this project is intentionally bad in respect to code quality, the entire bot is a joke.
